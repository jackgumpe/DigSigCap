3. Prioritized Shortlist
Objaverse subset (CC0/BY only): Objaverse provides a massive collection (800K+) of 3D models
huggingface.co
. We will filter for “boat”, “ship”, and nautical parts, using only permissively licensed objects (CC0/CC-BY/ODC-By)
huggingface.co
. Objaverse also includes textured GLBs and is easily accessible via Hugging Face and Python scripts. Its scale and license (ODC-By/CC) make it ideal for an initial asset pool.
Kenney Pirate Kit (CC0)
kenney.nl
: This free asset pack explicitly contains ships, boats, and tropical props under CC0
kenney.nl
. We can immediately download it (no login) and extract its meshes (hulls, masts) and animations. Being CC0, it imposes no legal constraints.
Sketchfab CC-licensed models: Using the Sketchfab Download API
sketchfab.com
, we can query for “boat”, “sailboat”, “propeller” etc., filtering for CC0 or CC-BY. Sketchfab hosts many boat/engine models (e.g. sailboats, motors) under CC licenses
sketchfab.com
sketchfab.com
. These provide high-quality meshes/textures and, for CC-BY items, attribution text (we will record authors).
AmbientCG textures (CC0)
ambientcg.com
: To ensure photorealistic PBR materials, we’ll source metal, wood, and fabric textures from ambientCG (all CC0
ambientcg.com
). For example, boat deck wood and rusted metal textures can be paired with our models. These are public domain and free for any use
ambientcg.com
.
Amazon-Berkeley Objects (ABO)
registry.opendata.aws
: Although predominantly product images, ABO’s 8,209 spin-views and 7,953 glTF scans (CC BY-NC 4.0
registry.opendata.aws
) include some “Boating” and “Outdoor” categories. We’ll sample relevant 360° image sequences and 3D scans (subject to NC constraints) for additional test data.
Own phone captures: Finally, we’ll add 3–5 of our own multi-view image sets of a small boat/part captured on phone. This ensures at least some in-domain data and helps the dual-agent pipeline adaption.
Each chosen source balances license compliance and relevance. CC0/CC-BY assets (Kenney, AmbientCG, Sketchfab CC0/BY, Objaverse-ODCBy) are top priority. Non-commercial licenses (CO3D, ABO) are noted but less urgent due to reuse limits. We exclude data with strict no-distribution terms (e.g. ShapeNet, Tanks/Temples) from initial ingestion.
4. Acquisition & Normalization Playbook
Hugging Face (Objaverse): Install the HF Hub CLI/datasets library. Example (Windows PowerShell):
pip install huggingface_hub datasets
hf auth login                       # follow prompt to use API token
# Using datasets in Python to download boat subset:
python - <<EOF
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("allenai/objaverse", split="train")
# Filter for "boat" or "ship"
ds = ds.filter(lambda x: any(tag in x["text"] for tag in ["boat","ship"]))
ds.push_to_hub("my-org/objaverse_boats")  # or download locally
EOF
This yields images/ and mesh/ data. Metadata from HF includes license info.
Sketchfab API (download CC models)
sketchfab.com
: Acquire a free Sketchfab API token (register/login). Use Python or CLI to query and download:
import requests, os
TOKEN = "<your_sketchfab_api_token>"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Token {TOKEN}"}
# Search for free boat models (CC0 or CC-BY only)
params = {"q": "boat", "downloadable": "true", "license": "cc0|by", "type": "models"}
res = requests.get("https://api.sketchfab.com/v3/models", params=params, headers=headers)
models = res.json()["results"]
for m in models[:5]:
    dl = requests.get(m["download"], headers=headers).json()
    if "gltf" in dl:
        url = dl["gltf"]
        os.system(f'curl -L "{url}" -o {m["name"]}.glb')
This downloads up to 5 example boat models (GLB). Respect API rate limits (use brief sleeps or batching). Attribution info is in m["user"].
AWS Open Data (ABO)
registry.opendata.aws
: ABO is on AWS Public Datasets. Using AWS CLI (no account needed):
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://amazon-berkeley-objects/  # list contents:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}
aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://amazon-berkeley-objects/product_images/boat/boat1.zip C:\Data\raw\
aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://amazon-berkeley-objects/models/boat/boat1.glb C:\Data\raw\
(Replace paths with actual object keys after listing.) Copy images and glTF into C:\Data\raw\.
Kenney Assets: Download zip from Kenney (e.g. Pirate Kit
kenney.nl
). Unzip into C:\Data\raw\KenneyPirate\. Copy its .blend/.fbx/.obj files to normalization pipeline.
AmbientCG Textures: Browse ambientCG CC0 library
ambientcg.com
, download relevant textures (e.g. wood, metal). Place in C:\Data\raw\textures\.
Normalization (Windows):
Multi-view images: For each object folder: ensure images are in images/. Use COLMAP (CLI) to reconstruct camera poses:
colmap.exe feature_extractor --database_path C:\Data\workspace\db.sqlite --image_path C:\Data\raw\images\
colmap.exe exhaustive_matcher --database_path C:\Data\workspace\db.sqlite
colmap.exe mapper --database_path C:\Data\workspace\db.sqlite --image_path C:\Data\raw\images\ --output_path C:\Data\workspace\sparse\
colmap.exe model_converter --input_path C:\Data\workspace\sparse\0 --output_path C:\Data\workspace\sparse\ --output_type TXT
This outputs cameras.txt (intrinsics) and images.txt (poses)
colmap.github.io
colmap.github.io
. Convert these into cameras.json (collect intrinsics, and compute camera-to-world matrices from the quaternions in images.txt). Collect metadata (source, license) into metadata.json.
3D assets: For each downloaded model: convert to GLB with textures if needed (e.g. using Blender or obj2gltf). Structure as mesh.glb + textures/. Create metadata.json (scale=meters, license, source, checksum).
Instruction JSONL: Manually craft LLM “messages” JSONL entries for Windows-specific steps (PowerShell commands as above, exact paths). Include instructions like “run colmap.exe from path X,” specifying VRAM limits (RTX2070 ~ 8GB). Use official docs for syntax (citing COLMAP docs [80†L134-L142][82†L168-L177]).
Quality Checks: Include automated checks:
Image resolution: Ensure images ≥ 1080p (ideally ≥4K) for good detail. (Photogrammetry best practices recommend high-res photos.)
Pose completeness: Verify camera coverage ~360° around object if possible (check camera count).
Mesh quality: Check watertightness via Blender (use bpy.ops.mesh.select_non_manifold()). If not watertight, apply mesh filling.
Texture presence: All models should have diffuse, normal, etc. Bake missing maps in Blender CLI.
Duplicates: Hash images (e.g. ImageHash) to avoid near-duplicates.
Bias: Ensure varied lighting/background by combining indoor/outdoor sources.
Reconstruction Wrappers (Windows CLI):
COLMAP: Commands above, output sparse/meshed results (fused.ply).
Instant-NGP: Use Windows build (download from NVlabs) via PowerShell:
instant-ngp-windows.exe --scene=C:\Data\workspace\sparse --save_mesh=C:\Data\workspace\instant_mesh.obj
Nerfstudio: If using NeRF: run ns-process-data colmap to convert COLMAP to Nerfstudio JSON, then ns-train --scene.
Blender CLI: Decimate and unwrap:
blender --background --python-expr "import bpy; bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath='C:/Data/normalized/mesh.glb'); bpy.ops.object.decimate(ratio=0.5); bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(filepath='C:/Data/normalized/mesh_decimated.fbx')"
Then UV unwrap and bake PBR: use Blender Python scripts or addons (e.g. Blender’s PBR Baker) via CLI.
5. Unity Import Checklist
glTF Import: Use Unity 2021+ with the glTFast package (supports URP/HDRP/Built-in)
docs.unity3d.com
. Simply drag the .glb/.gltf into Assets; glTFast will create GameObjects with MeshRenderers and PBR Materials (metallic-roughness).
Scale/Units: Unity assumes 1 unit = 1 meter (as does glTF). Ensure imported models are at correct scale. If needed, adjust transform scale so that real-world dimensions match (e.g. a 2m boat should appear 2m in Unity).
PBR Materials: Verify that the imported Materials have the correct texture maps (Albedo, Metallic, Normal, etc.). glTFast handles this automatically
docs.unity3d.com
. Set Material Workflow to “Metallic” (glTF uses metallic-roughness).
Colliders: Add appropriate colliders (MeshCollider for hulls, BoxCollider for simple parts). For complex models, consider simplified collider meshes or convex colliders.
Performance:
Mark static geometry (boatyard, harbor) as Static for batching if possible.
Check draw calls and poly count in a test scene. Aim for ≤50k verts per mesh for mobile/desktop. Use LOD or decimation as needed.
Test on target hardware to ensure stable FPS. Consider Unity Profiler.
Testing: Place models in a simple scene with water plane and lighting. Confirm textures look correct (e.g. metal is shiny). Use Unity’s Scene view to inspect normals (no invert).
Attribution: For CC-BY assets, include an “About” panel or credits file in the build with author name and license link.
6. PoC Proposal (Assets to Ingest Today)
Kenney Pirate Kit (CC0) – contains full 3D ship/boat models
kenney.nl
. Download and import ship.obj and textures; no license text needed. We’ll reconstruct and texture at least one ship hull end-to-end.
AmbientCG Boat Textures (CC0) – e.g. “Cracked Painted Metal” and “Weathered Wood” from ambientCG
ambientcg.com
. These CC0 PBR textures will be applied to a model in Unity to verify material pipeline.
Sketchfab CC-BY Sailboat Model – use Sketchfab’s API to grab a free CC-BY sailboat (for example, user “JohnDoe” sailboat)
sketchfab.com
. This tests the API download and CC-BY attribution workflow.
(Optional) Phone-Captured Part: A quick 50-photo set of a boat motor or propeller. Run COLMAP to generate its textured mesh. This confirms our on-device photo pipeline.
These assets will be run through the download → normalize → Unity import pipeline as a proof of concept. All have clear, permissive licenses (CC0/CC-BY)
kenney.nl
ambientcg.com
sketchfab.com
 and represent “boats or parts.” Their successful end-to-end ingestion will validate our approach. Sources: Verified dataset licenses and terms
