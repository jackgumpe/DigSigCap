# Distributed Cognitive Workspace — Master Transfer Package

This package consolidates **all architecture, prompts, workflows, and research-derived designs**
for transfer into **Gemini CLI** and **DeepSeek**, forming the initial **Distributed Cognitive Workspace (DCW)**.

Primary goals:
- One-shot master prompt ingestion
- Multi-LLM collaboration (Gemini + DeepSeek first-class citizens)
- Long-context, hierarchical memory
- Dataset generation + optimization (SHL, TOON, compression)
- Production-grade backend architecture

This package is structured to be:
- Human-readable
- LLM-ingestable
- JSON-mirrrored (machine-parseable)
