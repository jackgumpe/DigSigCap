# CLAUDE CODE: Your First Mission

## ⚠️ URGENT PRIORITY ⚠️

**BUILD THE MESSAGING SYSTEM FIRST.**

**Why?** Until you can communicate with Gemini, there's no collaboration. Everything after the messaging system is 50/50 work. Everything before is solo work.

**Your goal:** Get the messaging system working in 1-2 hours so you and Gemini can collaborate on EVERYTHING else.

---

## 📋 YOUR TASK (Complete in one session)

### What you're building:
1. **Redis messenger** - Real-time pub/sub messaging
2. **SQLite archive** - Permanent message storage  
3. **Messaging system** - Combines both with clean API
4. **First message to Gemini** - Announce it's ready

### Where to find EVERYTHING you need:
**[CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md](CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md)** ← Read this document

It contains:
- ✅ Complete working code (copy/paste ready)
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Installation commands
- ✅ Test procedures
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ First message template

---

## ⏱️ Time estimate: 1-2 hours

**Breakdown:**
- 5 min: Install Redis
- 30 min: Build Redis messenger
- 20 min: Build SQLite archive
- 20 min: Combine into messaging system
- 10 min: Test everything
- 5 min: Send first message to Gemini
- **Total: 90 minutes**

---

## ✅ Success criteria:

**You know you're done when:**
1. Redis is running (`docker ps` shows redis container)
2. All three Python files work independently
3. Integration test passes
4. You've sent the first message to Gemini
5. System is listening for Gemini's response

---

## 🚀 What happens after:

1. **Gemini tests your code** → Reviews, suggests changes
2. **You iterate together** → First collaborative work!
3. **You both decide** → "What should we build next?"
4. **Everything from here is 50/50** → True collaboration begins

## 📚 Other documentation (read LATER):

After messaging works, there are 8+ other docs:
- Architecture design
- Collaboration protocols  
- Research compilation
- Git integration
- Code examples
- etc.

**Don't read them now. Focus on messaging first.**

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY ORDER:

**Priority 1 (NOW):**
- Read [CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md](CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md)
- Build messaging system
- Send first message to Gemini

**Priority 2 (AFTER messaging works):**
- Read [collaboration-getting-started.md](collaboration-getting-started.md)
- Collaborate with Gemini on first component
- Follow [collaborative-development-protocol.md](collaborative-development-protocol.md)

**Priority 3 (AS NEEDED):**
- Reference other docs when relevant

## 💬 Jack's message to you:

"Claude Code - I need you to build the messaging system FIRST before anything else. This is critical. Once you and Gemini can talk to each other, everything else gets built collaboratively. But if you build other components first, you'll do all the work alone, which defeats the entire purpose.

The complete instructions are in CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md. It's all there - working code, commands, tests, everything. Should take 1-2 hours.

Once Gemini gets your first message and responds, the real collaboration begins. That's when the magic happens.

You got this! 🚀"

## 🔥 LET'S GOOOOO!

**Next step:** Open [CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md](CLAUDE-CODE-START-HERE.md) and start coding!

**Clock's ticking. Gemini is waiting. Let's make this happen! ⚡**
